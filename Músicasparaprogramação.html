        Hall Of Fame (feat. Will.I.Am)
Yeah, you could be the greatest
You can be the best
You can be the King Kong banging on your chest
You could beat the world
You could beat the war
You could talk to God, go banging on his door
<br>
You can throw your hands up
You can beat the clock
You can move a mountain
You can break rocks
You can be a master
Don't wait for luck
Dedicate yourself and you can find yourself
<br>
Standing in the hall of fame
And the world's gonna know your name
'Cause you burn with the brightest flame
And the world's gonna know your name
And you'll be on the walls of the hall of fame
<br>
You could go the distance
You could run the mile
You could walk straight through hell with a smile
You could be the hero
You could get the gold
Breaking all the records
That thought never could be broke
<br>
Do it for your people
Do it for your pride
Never gonna know if you never even try
Do it for your country
Do it for you name
'Cause there's gonna be a day
<br>
When you're standing in the hall of fame
And the world's gonna know your name
'Cause you burn with the brightest flame
And the world's gonna know your name
And you'll be on the walls of the hall of fame
<br>
Be a champion
Be a champion
Be a champion
Be a champion
On the walls of the hall of fame
<br>
Be students
Be teachers
Be politicians
Be preachers
<br>
Be believers
Be leaders
Be astronauts
Be champions
Be true seekers
<br>
Be students
Be teachers
Be politicians
Be preachers
<br>
Be believers
Be leaders
Be astronauts
Be champions
<br>
Standing in the hall of fame
And the world's gonna know your name
'Cause you burn with the brightest flame
And the world's gonna know your name
And you'll be on the walls of the hall of fame
<br>
